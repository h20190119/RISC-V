# RISC-V

## RISC V RV32I Implementation

In this project, a RISC V CPU is implemented in verilog. It almost fully supports each type of RV32I instructions (excluding CSRs and FENCEs)
		

There are 3 different types of architectures that have been explored as part of this project. 

## Single Cycle Design
## Multi Cycle Design
## Pipeline Design
